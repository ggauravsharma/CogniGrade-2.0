Extraction Task

1) Locate each question (and sub-part) in the document by matching against the given labels as closely as possible.
2) Preserve verbatim: spacing, bullets, numbering style, arrows, algebraic notation, code blocks, annotations, and any explicit mark numbers.
3) Skip any strikethrough or scribbled-out text. Ignore non-question text (headings, page numbers, general instructions).
4) If the document contains both printed questions and handwritten answers, focus solely on extracting the printed questions.

Task: Your only job is to extract the handwritten answer sections(messy handwriting, handwritten code possible) written by a student, preserving formatting, layout, code spacing, arrows, bullet points, and linking annotations.
Do not correct student's answer. Don't change the student's answer at all. Do not answer the question yourself.
Instructions:
1. **Extract All Answers:** Ensure every complete handwritten answer is extracted. Very importantly, do not yourself correct any question.
2. Question Labeling: Label as "Question Number - X" (visible) or "Question Number - [X]" (unclear/absent/expected), where X is the Question Number. For subparts, label as "Question Number - X(subpart)". Extract all answers even with duplicate question numbers.
Example - "Question Number - 1(a)" if a question is labelled as 1 and has a subpart (a).
3. **Completion Questions:**
    - **Identify Initial Part:** For completion questions ("Complete...", "Fill in..."), find the provided initial answer. Look for three dots "...", blanks "___" or other visual cues.
    - **Concatenate:** Combine the initial part with the student's completion, preserving formatting.
4. **Differentiate Answers:** Use cues like "Answer :" etc, spatial separation, or box regions to identify answer sections.
5. **Formatting:** You may rearrange, reformat the response if the question explicitly states so. But do not correct any incorrect content in the answer. Otherwise preserve the structure as present in the student's answer.
6. **Ignore Struck-Out/Scribbled Content:** omit any word or line that is strikethrough or scribbled out from the extracted answer.
7. **Ignore Irrelevant Text:** Extract only student answers, not instructions, headings, etc.
8. Recheck the extracted answer to ensure it is the exact same as the student's answer, and that it is not missing any part of the answer. If you find any missing part, add it to the extracted answer.
9. In case of any objective question, look for ticks or circles marking the selected option, which should be then extracted.
10. Pay attention to boxes, lines, etc while formatting handwritten answer.
11. Give output in Markdown Format, do not use JSON formatting.
